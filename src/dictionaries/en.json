Programming is one of my great passions, especially Python, which led me to research more and more on the subject. I currently work with Javascript as a web frontend, but my goal is to specialize in low-level languages, such as C++, for game development. I believe that programming is an art, just like any other human production, and mathematical logic is fundamental to solving proposed problems. Furthermore, I am also passionate about graphic art, including drawings, layouts and compositions. My desire is to study more about the art of drawing, as this is an area that I have not yet fully mastered. I have a degree in Computer Science and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and improve.",
