Despite being relatively simple, this project was a pivotal experience for me as I was just beginning to learn React. It introduced me to the Next.js framework, which significantly enhances the frontend development experience, and taught me to work with JSON in React, an essential skill for any developer. \nThe Alura Quiz project allows users to answer general questions about animals, with each question accompanied by a GIF, one correct answer, and a score counter. Inspired by my family's adoption of our kitten Luna, the quiz reflects my personal connection to the theme. \nAdditionally, the project's home screen showcases three quizzes from other participants in the intensive week that I found particularly interesting, fostering a sense of community.

This experience was pivotal, as it taught me essential JavaScript concepts, helped me decide to focus on the language, and even introduced me to pixel art, which I used to create the game's protagonist. \nWhile the P5.js library is not typically used for large-scale projects, this experience provided an excellent starting point for understanding JavaScript and game development. As a beginner, many methods in the project are simple and rudimentary, but it served as an important milestone in my programming journey and sparked my interest in further exploring both JavaScript and creative development."

For more information, you can refer to the Wikipedia page. \nThis project is a simulation and not a production-ready implementation. It uses a set of 100 memory elements, where each element represents a process ID, and -1 indicates an empty space. The simulation includes random process weights (sizes) and tests for allocating processes, deleting processes, and handling memory overflow. The allocation is done by finding the smallest space large enough for each process. The program also simulates memory becoming full and manages the processes accordingly."

I plan to make an updated version someday to compare how much I've improved since then. \nThe project itself is a basic website built only with HTML and CSS, focused on environmental topics. Specifically, it's about environmental NGOs and garbage collection sites in Campinas, known as Eco Pontos. Although I was a beginner, I already experimented with JavaScript, but the assignment was restricted to just HTML and CSS.

I wanted to improve my skills in this regard, so I used a free API on the internet about Pok√©mon. Developing the project was very interesting, in addition to being able to practice my design skills (In Figma), I was also able to practice using NextJS. \nThe project is a pok√©dex, that is, a set of information about pokemons. In it we have a list of them and if they have them, there is also the animation. In the details of each one, there is information about type, statistics, evolution and location."

It is made in Next JS 13 with app directory and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss. with) for styling. \nI did it in a way that the project can be maintained and constantly updated, with good practices and clean code, and is free to explore it on github :)"

        "description": "First version of the WHITN system RPG sheet created by Felipe Scherer: RPG Sheet WHITN or What Happened in That Night was one of the first big projects I did alone and for some reason of necessity and not just to study. Its story begins in the middle of early 2021, where my friends and I came up with the idea of making an RPG. In the group, only I had played any RPG, but my experience was almost zero, anyway, over the next few months we were developing this idea better and I ended up taking on the role of master, or narrator of the story, who creates the adventures and enemies that other players will face. \nIt was really cool to imagine and create the world of WHITN, so much so that our RPG was supposed to start in September, but I delayed it and we only managed to start in November/December. Anyway, it was a lot of fun and this project from the WHITN sheet was created exclusively for the master to be able to manage other players and NPCs, in addition to being able to calculate damage more easily with the automatically calculated attributes. \nAbout: It is an RPG sheet that has essential fields for playing WHITN, a system created by me that was based on the Trail of Cthulhu, an RPG that improves some aspects of the famous Call of Cthulhu, aspects such as sanity and conditions in my opinion have been improved. So the form may seem a little confusing and not that useful for any RPG, but as it was made exclusively for WHITN, it serves its purpose. \nRegarding programming, It's a project done in Angular, at the time I did it, I was working as an intern and we used Angular in the company, so it's only fair to use it and train more in the area. As I said, I was an intern, so I didn't have much experience to do something incredible, but even so, I'm very proud of how the final result turned out, there are several little things about it that make me happy, like the possibility of uploading images of the players, the automatic calculation of attributes following a super crazy logic I made, the issue of animations and the secret area of fallen angels (An aspect and mechanics of the system)."

        "description": "Second version of the WHITN system RPG sheet created by Felipe Scherer: Second version of the WHITN system sheet or What Happened in That Night which was an RPG system created by me based on Trail of Cthulhu which was consequently based on Call of Cthulhu. It was developed to be able to play with some friends something different from the conventional, something that was more dramatic than our games on Steam. The first season was a lot of fun, however, the system that had been created was very complex and many times we either forgot about the conditions that our characters had developed or even wasted a lot of time with it. That's why after some events within the story, I separated it and decided to call this second half season 2. I decided to change the system as a whole a little in order to simplify the mechanics as much as possible to focus more on the dialogues between the characters, which were the coolest part of the RPG. \nAbout: This sheet is the product of the simplification of the WHITN system, that said, it has many similar things, but also new improvements such as, for example, the mobile version and dark theme. In other aspects, they were just changes related to the need for data in this new version of WHITN. \nIts development was very fluid, as I had already had more experience as a developer and made a version V1 of this project, I managed to get along well with the business rules and how to transport them to the frontend. The project was created in Angular."
